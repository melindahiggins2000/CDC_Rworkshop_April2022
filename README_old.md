## Overview

This workshop will cover:
* An introduction to R and RStudio – getting familiar with the R language and working in the RStudio IDE (integrated development environment);
* Learning about data structures, getting into and out of R, cleaning data, intro to data wrangling;
* Performing basic statistical analyses and models plus formatting output (statistics and tables) from R; 
* Visualizing data and models with ggplot2; 
* Brief intro to making simple choropleth maps; and
* Getting started writing reports/dynamic documentation (basic principle of reproducible research) using RMarkdown and knitr;
* [time permitting] data merging including joins and restructuring rows and columns (long to wide datasets and visa-versa); introduction to other reporting and communication formats such as dashboard, websites, book-format templates and more; introduction to statistical models and analyses using R (such as linear and logistic regression); or other topics as requested by attendees.


This workshop is all about the art and science of visualizing data with R. Learn about the what (types of visualizations, tools to produce them), the how (start with a design, pre-process the data, map it to graphical attributes, make strategic decisions about visual encoding, post-process for readability and visual appeal), and the why (the theory behind the grammar of graphics). Do it all in R, reproducibly, and using a variety of modern data visualization packages, primarily ggplot2.
