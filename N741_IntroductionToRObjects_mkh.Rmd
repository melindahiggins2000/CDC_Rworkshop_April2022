# Everything in R is captured as an "object"

When you type a simple equation `2+2` in the **Console** it is "saved" in temporary memory as an "object".

```{r}
2 + 2
```

--

To "recall" this value saved in temporary memore, we can call `.Last.value` which is the object where the value `4` is saved.

```{r eval=FALSE}
.Last.value
```

```
[1] 4
```

---

# **ASSIGN** your results to an "object", use .big[**<-**] 

.pull-left[

Using `.Last.value` is inefficient, so we need to save/store this value in an object. An object is a text string we use to retrieve the value (or elements) we saved. Let's save the results of `2+2` in an object `result`.

For this we will use the **ASSIGN** operator .big[**`<-`**].

```{r}
result <- 2+2
```
]

--

.pull-right[

This is saved now in your "Global Environment". To retrieve this value, simply type the text string `result` to see the value `4`.

```{r}
result
```

]

# Object Types

Use `class()` function to find out what the object type is.

.pull-left[
Numeric

```{r}
x <- 3.1415
class(x)
```

Character

```{r}
favsnack <- "hummus"
class(favsnack)
```

Logical - directly assigned (no quotes, ALL CAPS)

```{r}
likebeets <- TRUE
class(likebeets)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

Get responses: 1=No, 2=Yes

```{r}
beetchoice <- c(1,1,2,2,1)
class(beetchoice)
```

Logical - as result of a "test". Notice the use of the logical operator `==`.

```{r}
likebeets <- beetchoice == 2
likebeets
class(likebeets)
```

# Object Type Scalar - single values

Scalar - one value (numeric or text)

```{r}
x <- 3.1415
class(x)
```

--

```{r}
y <- "brocalli"
class(y)
```

--

```{r}
z <- FALSE
class(z)
```

--

To see what is in an object, just type the name.

```{r}
y
```


---

# Object type Vector

.pull-left[
A vector is multiple values combined `c()` of same type

```{r}
w <- c(3.1415, 6.626E-34, 343)
class(w)
v <- c("brocalli","spinach","carrots")
class(v)
```

Confirm these are vectors with `is.vector()`

```{r}
is.vector(w)
```
]

--

.pull-right[

Vectors are only 1-dimensional - only 1 row or 1 column. We can get how long they are (number of elements) using `length()`.

```{r}
length(v)
```

**Pick an element:** To see a specific element of a vector use square brackets `[]`'s to specify the index of that element. For example, let's view the 2nd element of `v`.

```{r}
v[2]
```

]

---

# Mixing data types

.pull-left[
```{r}
class(x)
class(y)
class(z)
```

What happens if we combine different data types?
]

--

.pull-right[
Combine `x` (numeric) and `y` (character)

```{r}
xy <- c(x,y)
xy
```

Why does 3.1415 have `"`'s around it?

```{r}
class(xy)
```

By mixing numeric and character values R chooses a data type that will best retain ALL of the values. "3.1415" is now the string of characters that represent that number.
]

---

# Thinking exercise

Combine `x` (numeric) and `z` (logical) - what do you get?

--

```{r}
xz <- c(x,z)
xz
```

Why is the second value 0?

--

```{r}
class(xz)
```

It turns out that the logical values of `TRUE` and `FALSE` can be represented as the numbers 1 (for `TRUE`) and 0 (for `FALSE`). Thus `FALSE` was converted to 0 so we have combined numeric values.

---

# Thinking Exercise

Combine `y` (character) and `z` (logical) - what do you get?

--

```{r}
yz <- c(y,z)
yz
```

Notice that `"FALSE"` has `"`'s around it.

--

```{r}
class(yz)
```

Even though `FALSE` can convert to a numeric value of 0, when combined with character values, it is also converted to a string of characters that represent the word `"FALSE"`

---

# Matrix - 2-dimensional combination of same type

.pull-left[

Use `matrix()` function

```{r}
X <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Y <- c(23, 34, 32, 21, 28)
Z <- c(4.4, 3.0, 3.4, 2.2, 3.8)
mtx <- matrix(c(X,Y,Z), nrow=5, ncol=3)
mtx
class(mtx)
```

]

--

.pull-right[

Get dimensions using `dim()`

```{r}
dim(mtx)
```

**Pick an element:** Notice there are 2 dimensions. So, if we want to see the data at ROW=2 and COLUMN=3, we  use `[]` to select specific [ROW, COLUMN].

```{r}
mtx[2, 3]
```
]

---

# Matrix - select a whole row or a column

.pull-left[
### Display Matrix `mtx`

```{r}
mtx
```
]

--

.pull-right[
**Pick a row:** We can pick row 4 by leaving the column index blank.

```{r}
mtx[4, ] # 4th row of the matrix
```

**Pick a column:** We can pick row 4 by leaving the column index blank and pick column 3 by leaving the row index blank.

```{r}
mtx[, 3] # 3rd column of the matrix
```

]
---

# Can I add a different data type to a Matrix?

.pull-left[
```{r}
A <- c("apple","banana","grapes","apple","orange")
mtx2 <- matrix(c(X,Y,Z,A), nrow=5, ncol=4)
mtx2
```

Why are there `"`'s?

]

--

.pull-right[
The first matrix `mtx` was numeric.

```{r}
is.numeric(mtx)
```

But adding `A` to `mtx2` made everything character!!

```{r}
is.numeric(mtx2)
is.character(mtx2)
```
]

--

.footnote[So how the heck do I combine different data types?]

---

# Data Frame - same # rows, diffierent column types

.pull-left[

Create using `data.frame()` function

```{r}
id <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
age <- c(23, 34, 32, 21, 28)
fruit <- c("apple","banana","grapes",
           "apple","orange")
beets <- c(TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE)
df <- data.frame(id, age, fruit, beets)
df
```
]

--

.pull-right[
See column (variable) names, `names()`

```{r}
names(df)
```

Get dimension, `dim()`

```{r}
dim(df)
```

See structure, `str()`

```{r}
str(df)
```

]

---

# Data Frame - Select elements, rows, columns 

.pull-left[
### Using [ , ] index selector

Just like matrices, we can select element using the [row, column] index notation.

```{r}
df[2, 4] # value at 2nd row, 4th column
df[1, ] # all data on row 1
df[, 4] # all data in column 4
```
]

--

.pull-right[
### Using $ selector

However, columns in data frames can also be selected by their column names using the .big[`$`] selector.

Column names:

```{r}
names(df)
```

Show the `fruit` column (variable) values.

```{r}
df$fruit
```

]

# Lists are Unstructured and Useful!

.pull-left[

While data frames are tidy rectangular structures with exact rows and columns, often real data is messy. It can be handy to combine multiple types of data structures together. R uses **lists** for this.

List can have different objects types combined.

```{r}
# combine 
# x = scalar numeric vale
# age = numeric vector
# mtx = numeric matrix
# df = data frame with mixed variable types
list1 <- list(x, age, mtx, df)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
list1
```
]

--

.footnote[This may not seem useful now, but it will be handy later on... We'll discuss these more later.]
