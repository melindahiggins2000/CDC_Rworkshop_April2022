# Numeric Data in R

.pull-right[
### CONTINUOUS - numeric (double)
    
```{r}
x <- c(1.12, 1.13, 4.23)
class(x)
```

### DISCRETE - integer

```{r}
y <- as.integer(c(1,2,3,4))
class(y)
```
]

# Non-numeric Data in R

```{r out.width = '80%', echo=FALSE}

# Nominal Data 

.left-column[
```{r out.width = '100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/nominal.jpg")

### From character (text strings)
    
```{r}
animal <- 
  c("turtle","snail","butterfly",
    "turtle","butterfly")

class(animal)
```

--

```{r}
table(animal) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Notice that these are in alphabetical order

# Nominal Data as "Factor"

.pull-left[
Suppose on a survey each nurse selects the hospital where they work:

1. Emory Hospital (on Clifton Road)
2. Emory Midtown
3. Emory Decatur
4. Saint Joseph's

And we get the 7 responses of: 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4

```{r}
hosp_choice <- c(1,1,2,3,2,2,4)
hospital <- 
  factor(hosp_choice,
         levels = c(1,2,3,4),
         labels = c("EHospital",
                    "EMidtown",
                    "EDecatur",
                    "St. Joe"))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Notice that the 

* `levels` corresponds to the response (choice) number and
* `labels` corresponds to the text of the response option.

```{r}
table(hospital) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Notice the responses are **in order by the response number** NOT alphabetical order.]

# Ordinal Data as "Factor"

.left-column[
```{r out.width = '=100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ordinal.jpg")
```
]

.right-column[
### Alphabetical Order is a Problem

Suppose we have "awful", "ok" and "awesome" as options for "how are you feeling today?" question.

```{r}
feeling <- 
  c("ok","ok","awesome","awful")
```

In a table, the default is alphabetical order:

```{r}
table(feeling) %>% knitr:: kable()
```
]

---

# Create Ordered Factor

List the text responses (levels) in the order you want and specify `ordered = TRUE`.

```{r}
feeling_ordf <- 
  factor(feeling,
         levels = c("awesome",
                    "ok",
                    "awful"),
         ordered = TRUE) #<<
```

--

Now the table is in a logical order

```{r}
table(feeling_ordf) %>% knitr:: kable()
```

---

# Binary Data

.left-column[
```{r out.width = '=100%', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/binary.jpg")
```
]

.right-column[
A variable is "binary" if it only has 2 values.

```{r}
animals <- c("shark","shark","dino","dino","shark")
table(animals) %>% knitr::kable()
```

Logical variables are also "binary".

```{r}
extinct <- animals == "dino"
table(extinct) %>% knitr::kable()
```

]

---

# Binary Data - Use TRUE=1, FALSE=0

A neat feature of **TRUE/FALSE** logical variables is that because they convert to `0=FALSE, 1=TRUE` you can use: 

* the `sum()` function to get the number (count) of **TRUE** and 
* use the `mean()` function to get the proportion of **TRUE**.

```{r}
sum(extinct)
mean(extinct)
```

```{r}
# multiply by 100 to get percent TRUE
mean(extinct)*100
```

Write a sentence in Rmarkdown with inline code using `` `r "\u0060r mean(extinct)*100\u0060"` `` to write:

"The percentage of extinct animals was `r mean(extinct)*100` %.
